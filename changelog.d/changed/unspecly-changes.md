- Changes that are not strictly compatible with
  [REUSE Specification v3.2](https://reuse.software/spec-3.2):
  - More `LICENSE` and `COPYING`-like files are ignored. Now, such files
    suffixed by `-anything` are also ignored, typically something like
    `LICENSE-MIT`. Files with the UK spelling `LICENCE` are also ignored.
